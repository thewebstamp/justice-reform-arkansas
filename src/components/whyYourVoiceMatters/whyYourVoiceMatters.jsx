      <h2>Your Voice Matters</h2>
      <p>
        Too many people have suffered in silence under a system built to exploit and oppress. Every time we raise our voice, we weaken the grip of injustice.
      </p>
      <p>
        This protest is not just about one case — it’s about exposing an entire system of abuse, greed, and corruption in Craighead County. We protest because people are being locked away unlawfully, because families are being destroyed, and because no one in power is being held accountable.
      </p>
