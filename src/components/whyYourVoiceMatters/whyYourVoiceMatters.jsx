      <h2>Your Voice Matters</h2>
      <p>
        Too many people have suffered in silence under a system where the most vulnerable are often overlooked. Every time we speak up, we bring attention to those who have been forgotten or mistreated.
      </p>
      <p>
        This protest is not about attacking institutions — it’s about demanding fairness, dignity, and oversight. We are coming together to advocate for humane treatment, transparency, and true justice in Craighead County and beyond.
