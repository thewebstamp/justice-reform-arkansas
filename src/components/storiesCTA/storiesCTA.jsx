      <h2>These Stories Demand Action</h2>
      <p>
        The corruption in Craighead County has destroyed lives, torn families apart, and buried truth behind locked doors. These stories are not isolated â€” they are part of a system that profits from injustice.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you or a loved one has been affected by this corrupt system, we encourage you to share your story. Your voice matters, and together, we can expose the truth and demand change.
      </p>
