      <h2>These Stories Demand Compassion</h2>
      <p>
        Whatâ€™s happening inside some Arkansas detention centers, including Craighead County, raises deep concerns about basic human dignity. Numerous reports from former inmates and families describe long-term isolation, denial of medical care, and other inhumane treatment.
      </p>
      <p>
        These are not isolated stories. They reflect a pattern of suffering that must be addressed. If you or someone you know has experienced mistreatment behind bars, your voice could help bring much-needed reform.
